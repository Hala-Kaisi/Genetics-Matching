# Genetics Patterns Matching


A JavaScript software that locates, counts, and searches for genetics patterns combinations in a given data and sequencing files.


Given data and sequencing files, the functionalities are to:

- count the occurance of genetics patterns;
- locate where such patterns are found;
- and, given specific patterns combinations, locate where these combinations are found and count them.

An example to the last functionality, if the letter **M** corresponds to the patterns **AA** and **CA**, count for both these patterns.
## Running Tests

To run tests, run this to count patterns

```bash
  node count_pattern.js
```
or this to locate such patterns

```bash
  node locate_pattern.js
```

or this command to count and locate patterns combinations

```bash
  node comb_patterns.js
```
